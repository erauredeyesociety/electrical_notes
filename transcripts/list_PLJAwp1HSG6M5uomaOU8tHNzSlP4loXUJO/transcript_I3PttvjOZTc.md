subject name circuit analysis topic name operational amplifier question find vo in the circuit in figure here in this circuit we have to find this Vo first of all we will make this circuit in our simulator app then we will check the value of VO and after that we will solve this problem here we can see this is our simulator first of all we have to draw op-amp where negative on top and this is an ideal op-amp so this is our op-amp then after that we need 1 2 3 3 registers here and one resistors here so total four resistors we need so we will draw registers now one resistor here one 2 3. then next two voltage source we need here please like this positive on upper side one and two then the value of this voltage source is 1 volt so this will be of one volt then this is of 2 volt then this resistor value is 2 kilo ohm so this is the two kilo ohm this is also of two kilo ohm this resistor value is 20 kilo ohm now here this is connected to non-inverting terminal of this op-amp these two resistors are connected together like this and here it is connected like this then this register connected here now this register connected here and this register is connected like this this is our Vo output voltage View so now again we will verify this circuit whether it is correct or not here this is a voltage of one volt that is in series with 2 kilo ohm so one volt voltage source in series with 2 kilo ohm then this is two volt voltage Force in series with two kilo ohm then this is of 20 kilo ohm this is the op-amp ideal op amp and this resistor is of one kilo ohm this is of 30 kilo ohm so this register value is 30 kilo ohm and we have to find vo that is this output voltage we have to find in this circuit now we will add scope here and we will take the value of this output so it is 14.089 volt so this is the answer we are getting in this op-amp circuit now what we will do we will solve the problem here so first of all we will redraw the circuit now we are assuming this as an ideal op-amp so let's say this node voltage is V minus and this node voltage is V plus this current is I minus and this current is I Plus first of all we have to find this V plus we can find this V plus by using voltage division rule the voltage across this 20 kilo Ohm resistor is V plus so up before that we will apply ideol of M condition apply IDL open condition s the ideal op-amp conditions are V plus is equal to V minus V plus is equal to V minus and second condition is I plus is equal to I minus is equal to 0. now here we will apply voltage division rule apply voltage division rule to find the voltage across this 20 kilo Ohm resistor so we can write V plus is equal to input voltage is 2 volt it will be 2 multiplied by resistor value across which we have to find the voltage it is 20 kilo ohm so it will be 20 multiplied by 10 to the power 3 divided by 20 multiplied by 10 to the power 3 then Plus series register with this resistor is 2 kilo ohm the 2 into 10 to the power 3. so this will be 2 into 2 multiplied by 20 divided by 20 plus 2. so it is 20 by 11. 20 by 11 this 10 to the power 3 from numerator and denominator will get canceled so the final answer is 20 divided by 20 plus 2 so 20 by 11 is the answer for V plus since it is voltage so unit will be volt then we know that according to Ideal op-amp condition V plus is equal to V minus so it is equal to 20 by 11 volt now we have the value of V plus and V minus now let's assume this current is capital i1 and this current is capital I2 so here we will apply at this node apply KCl at V minus apply JCL at V minus so according to KCl summation of all the currents entering a node is equal to summation of all the currents leaving the node there the entering current is this i1 so I 1 is equal to I minus plus I2 I minus plus I2 but according to Ideal op-amp condition I minus is equal to 0 so this term will be 0 therefore i1 is equal to I2 now we will write i1 in voltage form so i1 in voltage form will be 1 minus V minus divided by 2 kilo ohm 1 minus V minus divided by 2 into 10 to the power 3. is equal to 1 minus V minus divided by 2 kilo ohm is equal to V2 is equal to I2 now I2 in voltage form will be V minus minus vo this node voltage is vo so I2 is equal to V minus minus vo divided by 30 kilo ohm V minus minus v o divided by 30 kilo ohms so 30 into 10 to the power 3 now here we can clearly see on left hand side and on right hand side this 10 to the power 3 will get canceled this one upon 10 to the power 3 will get canceled so what's remain 1 minus V minus also the value of V minus is 20 by 11. so this will be 20 by 11 divided by 2. is equal to 20 by 11 minus vo divided by 30. now we will solve this and we will take this 30 on left hand side so this will be 1 minus 20 by 11 1 minus 20 by 11 divided by 2. so it is minus 9 by 22 multiplied by 30 if we take this 30 on this side so it will be minus 9 by 22 multiplied by 30. is equal to 20 by 11 minus Vo now if we take this 9 by 22 into 30 on right side and this view on left side so this will be vo is equal to 20 by 11. 20 by 11 and this will be plus 9 by 22 multiplied by 30. so if we solve this we will get the vo is equal to 20 by 11 Plus 9 by 22 multiplied by our teeth 9 by 22 multiplied by 30. so it is 14.09 14.09 14.09 volt so this is the answer for vo it is 14.09 volt what we have to find in this question we have to find v o in this circuit also using simulator app you can see that we have got 14.089 volt which is approximately equal to 14.09 volt so hence we can say this answer is correct if you find this video helpful then

find IB IC and V in the transistor Circuit of figure assume that the transistor operates in the active mode and that beta is equal to [Music] 15 solution we have to find IB IC and V this IB IC and this V the transistor operates in active mode so in active mode vbe is equal to 0.7 volt first we will redraw the circuit let's say this is Loop Number One and this is Loop Number Two now we will apply kvl to Loop 1 we will apply kvl to this Loop this will be positive negative positive negative or l two so we will start from suppose this point so this will will be - 4 + 20 kilohm so 20 10 to 3 into let's say this is current i1 let's say this is current i1 this is current I2 or directly we can write this is current IB IB then plus vbe e plus vbe e is equal to Z now in active mode vbe is equal to in active mode vbe is equal to 0.7 Vol so this will be -4 + 20 into 10 3 IB + 0.7 equal 0 so this will be 20 into 10 3 into IV is equal to 4 - 7 now this will be IB is equal to now this will be 3.3 0 3.30 by 20 into 10 3 this will be 3.30 by by 20 into 10 3 165 165 microampere this is [Music] IB next we have to find this IC so we will apply kvl to Loop Number [Music] Two apply KV L to Loop 2 let's say we will start from this point so minus B minus v o plus plus 100 + 100 + 100 in bracket current current is this in opposite direction I so minus i - i c then + 6 isal [Music] 0 + 6 is = 0 so this will be minus V - 100 I + 6 or directly is equal to - 6 now we have the value of beta as beta is equal to 50 so IC is equal to Beta I [Music] the value of this beta is 50 into IB IB is 165 microampere 165 into 10 to - 6 so IC is equal to 50 into 165 into 10 to - 6 this will be 8.25 8.25 milliamp [Music] milliampere next we have to find this V so we will put this value in this equation so minus V first we will write IC is equal to 8.25 m amp IB is equal 165 microampere then this minus V - 100 into this 8.25 into 10 - 3 is equal 6 - 6 so - V is = - 6 + 100 into 8.25 into 10us 3 so- V is equal to - 6 + 100 into 8.25 into 10 to - 3 - 5175 - 5175 volt so this will be therefore V is equal to 5175 volt for electrical and electronics engineering related questions and answers visit the link in the description below

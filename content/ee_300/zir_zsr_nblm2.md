This guide provides a synopsis of Zero-Input Response (ZIR) and Zero-State Response (ZSR) and outlines the steps for their calculation, primarily utilizing the Laplace Transform (LT) and S-domain circuit analysis.

### Synopsis of Zero-Input Response (ZIR) and Zero-State Response (ZSR)

The total response of an electric circuit can be separated into two components: the Zero-State Response (ZSR) and the Zero-Input Response (ZIR).

#### Zero-Input Response (ZIR)
The **Zero-Input Response (ZIR)** is the behavior of the circuit due to its **initial conditions** (like initial capacitor voltage or inductor current).

*   ZIR is calculated **as if there were zero input** (meaning the external input source is set to zero).
*   It is the response derived solely from the voltage on the capacitor (or current in the inductor) at the beginning ($t=0$).
*   ZIR is due to device characteristics and is therefore equivalent to the **natural response** of the circuit.
*   In the S-domain analysis of a capacitor, the ZIR component is generated by the initial condition source $V_c(0)/s$.

#### Zero-State Response (ZSR)
The **Zero-State Response (ZSR)** is the response due to the external input or charging/discharging of the capacitor, assuming the **initial state (condition) is zero**.

*   ZSR is the response due to the input source $V_s(s)$ when the initial state of the capacitor is zeroed.
*   It is the response due to the integral term in the transformed differential equation.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Calculating ZSR and ZIR

To calculate ZSR and ZIR, circuit analysis is typically performed using the Laplace Transform (LT) to convert the time-domain circuit into the S-domain. This approach allows for the use of the **superposition method** to separate the responses caused by the input source and the initial condition sources.

#### I. Circuit Preparation (S-Domain Transformation)

1.  **Develop the Differential Equation:** Derive the differential equation(s) that describe the circuit in the time domain.
2.  **Determine Initial Conditions:** Use circuit knowledge to find the output variable (voltage or current) for $t < 0$. This establishes the initial conditions, such as $v_c(0)$ or $i_L(0)$.
3.  **Transform to S-Domain:** Convert the circuit components and equations for $t \geq 0$ into the S-domain using the Laplace Transform.
4.  **Model Components with Initial Conditions:** In the S-domain, reactive devices (capacitors and inductors) are replaced by their impedance plus a source representing the initial condition:
    *   **Capacitor:** Equivalent to an impedance $Z_C = 1/sC$ plus an initial voltage source $V_c(0)/s$.
    *   **Inductor:** Modeled similarly, including its impedance and initial current effect. (For inductors, current response is typically used; for capacitors, voltage response is typically used).

#### II. Calculation of Zero-State Response (ZSR)

The ZSR is the response due to the external input source(s) only, assuming zero initial state.

1.  **Zero Initial Conditions:** In the S-domain circuit, set all initial condition sources (e.g., $V_c(0)/s$) to zero.
    *   *Note:* If the initial condition is modeled as a voltage source, setting it to zero means replacing it with a short circuit.
2.  **Analyze Circuit for Input Response:** Using standard circuit analysis techniques (like KVL, KCL, Node method, or Current Divider), calculate the output variable of interest (e.g., $V_c(s)$ or $I_L(s)$), considering only the transformed external input source $V_s(s)$ or $I_s(s)$.
3.  **Identify ZSR in S-Domain:** The resulting expression, $V_{ZSR}(s)$ (or $I_{ZSR}(s)$), is the Zero-State Response in the S-domain.
4.  **Inverse Transform to Time Domain:** Perform the Inverse Laplace Transform (Inverse LT) on $V_{ZSR}(s)$ to obtain the time-domain Zero-State Response, $v_{ZSR}(t)$. This often involves using Partial Fraction Expansion (PFE) and the cover-up method to find the residues.

#### III. Calculation of Zero-Input Response (ZIR)

The ZIR is the response due to the initial conditions only, assuming zero input.

1.  **Zero External Input:** In the S-domain circuit, set all external input source(s) (e.g., $V_s(s)$ or $I_s(s)$) to zero.
    *   *Note:* If the external source is a voltage source, setting it to zero means replacing it with a short circuit.
2.  **Analyze Circuit for Initial Condition Response:** Calculate the output variable of interest (e.g., $V_c(s)$ or $I_L(s)$), considering only the initial condition sources (e.g., $V_c(0)/s$).
3.  **Identify ZIR in S-Domain:** The resulting expression, $V_{ZIR}(s)$ (or $I_{ZIR}(s)$), is the Zero-Input Response in the S-domain.
4.  **Inverse Transform to Time Domain:** Perform the Inverse Laplace Transform on $V_{ZIR}(s)$ to obtain the time-domain Zero-Input Response, $v_{ZIR}(t)$. ZIR terms will typically show the natural characteristics of the devices, defined by the poles determined by R, C, and L values.

#### IV. Total Response Calculation

1.  **Sum Responses:** The total response in the S-domain is the sum of the ZSR and ZIR responses:
    $$V_{total}(s) = V_{ZSR}(s) + V_{ZIR}(s)$$
2.  **Time Domain Result:** The total output in the time domain, $v_{total}(t)$, is the sum of the inverse transformed components:
    $$v_{total}(t) = v_{ZSR}(t) + v_{ZIR}(t)$$
3.  **Complete Solution:** Combine the waveform derived for $t \geq 0$ with the behavior determined for $t < 0$ for the complete solution.

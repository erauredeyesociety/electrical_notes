## I. Comprehensive Theory Overview: ZSR, ZIR, and Network Functions

The total response of a linear circuit can be separated using the principle of superposition into two components: the Zero-Input Response (ZIR) and the Zero-State Response (ZSR).

### A. Zero-Input Response (ZIR)
The **Zero-Input Response (ZIR)** is the circuit behavior due entirely to **stored energy** (initial conditions) in energy storage elements (capacitors and inductors).

*   **Definition:** ZIR is the response assuming there is zero external input or source.
*   **Origin:** It is derived from the initial voltage across a capacitor, $V_c(0)$, or the initial current through an inductor, $I_L(0)$.
*   **Time Domain Connection:** The ZIR is solely composed of the **natural response** of the circuit.

### B. Zero-State Response (ZSR)
The **Zero-State Response (ZSR)** is the circuit behavior due entirely to the external **input sources**.

*   **Definition:** ZSR is the response when the initial state of the circuit (stored energy) is set to zero.
*   **Input Requirement:** The ZSR occurs for any input, provided that before time $t<0$, no energy is stored in the network.

### C. Network Functions ($H(s)$)
The **Network Function, $H(s)$** (or $T(s)$), is the mathematical representation of the circuit's dynamic behavior in the $s$-domain and is fundamentally related to the ZSR.

*   **Definition:** The network function is the ratio of the **ZSR output** in the $s$-domain to the **ZSR input** in the $s$-domain.
    $$H(s) = \frac{\text{Output Variable}(s)}{\text{Input Variable}(s)}$$
*   **Requirement:** Network functions are found by explicitly setting all initial condition sources to zero.
*   **Time Domain Connection:** If the input is $V_{in}(s)$, the output ZSR is calculated as $V_{out}(s) = H(s) \cdot V_{in}(s)$.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Transfer Function ($H(s)$ or $T(s)$):** Input and output are at two different terminal pairs.
    *   **Driving-Point Impedance ($Z(s)$):** Ratio of voltage to current ($V/I$) measured at the same terminal pair.
    *   **Driving-Point Admittance ($Y(s)$):** Ratio of current to voltage ($I/V$) measured at the same terminal pair; $Y(s) = 1/Z(s)$.

## II. Poles and Zeros Explained

The network function $H(s)$ is expressed as a rational function, which means the numerator and the denominator are polynomials of $s$.

$$H(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$$

### A. What are Poles?

1.  **Definition:** The **poles** of the circuit (also known as natural frequencies) are the **roots of the characteristic polynomial**, which is the denominator of the network function, $D(s)=0$.
2.  **S-Domain Context:** Poles are locations on the $s$-plane where the network function $H(s)$ approaches infinity.
3.  **Time Domain/Diffeq Context:**
    *   **Natural Response:** Poles determine the **modes of the circuit**, which make up the natural response. Each distinct pole corresponds to an exponential term in the time domain solution.
    *   **Differential Equation:** Poles are determined by the **output side** (left side) of the differential equation after cross-multiplication.
    *   **Input Interaction:** Poles determine which exponentials are **always in the output**, even if they are not in the input. If the input frequency is the same as a pole frequency, the order of the pole in the output increases, leading to terms like $t \cdot e^{s_0 t}$.
    *   **Waveform:**
        *   Real poles ($s = -\alpha$): Lead to decaying exponentials ($k e^{-\alpha t}$).
        *   Complex-conjugate poles ($s = -\alpha \pm j\omega_d$): Lead to exponentially decaying sinusoids.

### B. What are Zeros?

1.  **Definition:** The **zeros** of the circuit are the **roots of the numerator** of the network function, $N(s)=0$.
2.  **S-Domain Context:** Zeros are locations on the $s$-plane where the network function $H(s)$ approaches zero.
3.  **Time Domain/Diffeq Context:**
    *   **Signal Blocking:** Zeros determine the rates of exponentials that are **never in the output**. An exponential input at the frequency of a zero will be blocked and will never appear in the circuit output.
    *   **Differential Equation:** Zeros are determined by the **input side** (right side) of the differential equation.

## III. Step-by-Step Guide for Poles and Zeros using Network Functions

The general process involves transforming the circuit into the $s$-domain, deriving the network function $H(s)$, and finding the roots of its constituent polynomials.

### Step-by-Step Process to Calculate $H(s)$

1.  **Transform the Circuit to $s$-Domain (Impedances):** Convert all reactive elements to their $s$-domain impedances, $Z(s)$:
    *   Resistors ($R$) become $R$.
    *   Capacitors ($C$) become $Z_C = 1/(sC)$.
    *   Inductors ($L$) become $Z_L = sL$.
2.  **Zero Initial Conditions:** To find $H(s)$ (the network function), treat all initial condition sources (like $V_c(0)/s$ or $L i_L(0)$) as zero (voltage sources become short circuits; current sources become open circuits).
3.  **Define $H(s)$:** Define the desired output $V_{out}(s)$ or $I_{out}(s)$ and the input $V_{in}(s)$ or $I_{in}(s)$.
4.  **Solve using $s$-Domain Circuit Techniques:** Use standard resistive circuit analysis techniques (KCL, KVL, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, voltage/current dividers) to find the ratio $H(s) = \frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Input}}$.
5.  **Express $H(s)$ as a Rational Function:** Simplify the expression into the proper rational function form:
    $$H(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} = \frac{a_m s^m + a_{m-1} s^{m-1} + \dots + a_0}{b_n s^n + b_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \dots + b_0}$$

### Step-by-Step Process to Find Poles and Zeros

1.  **Identify the Numerator $N(s)$ and Denominator $D(s)$** of the network function $H(s)$.
2.  **Find Zeros:** Set the numerator equal to zero and solve for $s$:
    $$N(s) = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \text{Roots are the Zeros}$$
3.  **Find Poles:** Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $s$. These are the roots of the characteristic equation:
    $$D(s) = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \text{Roots are the Poles}$$
4.  **Plot (Optional):** Plot the poles and zeros on the complex $s$-plane (pole-zero diagram).

## IV. Differential Equations from Circuits and Network Functions

The Laplace Transform (LT) is used to convert differential equations (ODEs) from the time domain into easier-to-solve partial fraction expressions (linear equations) in the $s$-domain. Conversely, you can derive the differential equation directly from $H(s)$.

### A. Creating the Differential Equation from a Circuit

This follows the standard circuit analysis process in the time domain:

1.  **Develop Differential Equation(s):** Use circuit analysis techniques (KCL/KVL) on the time-domain circuit to relate the input variable to the output variable, which will typically involve derivatives of voltage or current due to capacitors ($i_c = C \frac{dv_c}{dt}$) and inductors.
2.  **Solve (via LT):** Transform the equation into the $s$-domain, solve for the variable of interest, and then perform the inverse transform to get the time-domain waveform.

### B. Creating the Differential Equation from $H(s)$

A much simpler method to obtain the input-output differential equation (ODE) is to use the network function $H(s)$.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1.  **Start with $H(s)$:** Assume the network function is in the rational polynomial form relating output $V_{out}(s)$ and input $V_{in}(s)$:
    $$H(s) = \frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)} = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$$
2.  **Cross-Multiply:** Cross-multiply the terms:
    $$V_{out}(s) \cdot D(s) = V_{in}(s) \cdot N(s)$$
3.  **Substitute Derivatives:** Interpret $s$ as the differential operator $\frac{d}{dt}$:
    *   $s V_{out}(s) \rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} v_{out}(t)$
    *   $s^2 V_{out}(s) \rightarrow \frac{d^2}{dt^2} v_{out}(t)$
4.  **Write ODE:** Apply the inverse LT to the resulting expression. Since $H(s)$ only describes the ZSR, this transformation relies on setting initial conditions to zero.

$$\left(b_n \frac{d^n}{dt^n} + \dots + b_0 \right) v_{out}(t) = \left(a_m \frac{d^m}{dt^m} + \dots + a_0 \right) v_{in}(t)$$

**Poles and Zeros Link to Diffeq:**
The coefficients of $D(s)$ (the poles) become the coefficients of the terms involving the output variable and its derivatives on the left side of the ODE, while the coefficients of $N(s)$ (the zeros) become the coefficients of the terms involving the input variable and its derivatives on the right side of the ODE.

## V. Poles and Zeros in Time-Domain Response (Inverse Laplace Transform)

When converting the $s$-domain output $V_{out}(s)$ back to the time domain $v_{out}(t)$ using the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT), the final waveform is dictated by the poles of the overall function, $V_{out}(s) = H(s) \cdot V_{in}(s)$. The output waveform is the sum of the forced response and the natural response.

### A. Forced Response (Input Poles)

The **forced response** relates to the poles contributed by the **input signal, $V_{in}(s)$**.

*   If the input is an exponential $v_{in}(t) = K_i e^{s_0 t} u(t)$, the resulting forced response term in the output is also $K_f e^{s_0 t}$.
*   The magnitude $K_f$ is calculated using the cover-up method (PFE residue) but is equivalent to evaluating $H(s)$ at the input pole frequency, $s_0$: the amplitude is scaled by $H(s_0)$.

### B. Natural Response (Network Function Poles)

The **natural response** relates to the poles contributed by the **network function, $H(s)$**.

*   The natural response components, such as $k_i e^{p_i t}$, are determined by the locations of the poles $p_i$ of $H(s)$.
*   This response is characteristic of the device elements (R, L, C) and is independent of the specific external source (it exists even in the ZIR case).

### Step-by-Step Process for ILT and Time Response

1.  **Find Output in $s$-Domain:** Calculate $V_{out}(s) = H(s) \cdot V_{in}(s)$.
2.  **Factor:** Factor the denominator of $V_{out}(s)$ completely to find all pole locations ($p_i$). These include poles from $H(s)$ and poles from $V_{in}(s)$.
3.  **Partial Fraction Expansion (PFE):** Decompose $V_{out}(s)$ into a sum of simple terms corresponding to each distinct pole.
    $$V_{out}(s) = \frac{k_0}{s - s_0} + \frac{k_1}{s - p_1} + \dots$$
4.  **Find Residues ($k_i$):** Use the **Cover-Up Method** to find the residue $k_i$ associated with each pole $p_i$.
    *   For a simple pole $p_i$: $$k_i = \left. (s - p_i) V_{out}(s) \right|_{s=p_i}$$
    *   (If the poles are complex-conjugates, the residues $k_i$ will also be conjugate pairs).
    *   (If there are multiple-order poles, special techniques like matching coefficients or the $n$-to-1-order pole method are required for residues).
5.  **Inverse Transform:** Use the inverse LT properties to transform the PFE back to the time domain, $v_{out}(t)$. Each simple term $\frac{k_i}{s - p_i}$ transforms to $k_i e^{p_i t} u(t)$.
    *   **Result:** The terms corresponding to the poles of $H(s)$ form the natural response, and the terms corresponding to the poles of $V_{in}(s)$ form the forced response.


so how do i keep track of ZSR input vs output, ZIR input vs output, and using this for network funcitons and other things?

The process of analyzing circuits using the Laplace Transform (LT) hinges on separating the total response into the Zero-Input Response (ZIR) and the Zero-State Response (ZSR) using superposition. This separation is crucial for defining and utilizing the Network Function, $H(s)$.

Here is how you keep track of ZSR input versus output, ZIR input versus output, and how these relate to network functions.

## 1. Zero-State Response (ZSR) Tracking

The **Zero-State Response (ZSR)** is the component of the total response caused by **external input sources** when the circuit starts from a "zero state," meaning zero initial stored energy.

### ZSR Input vs. Output Tracking

| Parameter | Definition/Input | Output/Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input (Cause)** | **External Sources:** $V_{in}(s)$ or $I_{in}(s)$. This is the actual source driving the circuit (e.g., a voltage source $V_s(t)$ or current source $I_s(t)$) transformed into the $s$-domain. | **ZSR Output:** $V_{out, ZSR}(s)$ or $I_{out, ZSR}(s)$. This is the part of the total response resulting only from the input. |
| **Circuit State** | All initial conditions (stored energy) are set to zero (capacitors act as short circuits for voltage sources $V_c(0)/s$, inductors act as open circuits for current sources $L i_L(0)$). | The ZSR is calculated using the input source and the component impedances ($R$, $sL$, $1/sC$). |
| **Relationship** | The output is the result of applying $V_{in}(s)$ through the system defined by $H(s)$: $$ \mathbf{\text{Output}_{ZSR}(s) = H(s) \cdot \text{Input}_{ZSR}(s)} $$ |

The ZSR input is any waveform (step, exponential, sinusoid) that is applied at time $t \ge 0$, assuming that before $t<0$, no energy was stored in the network.

## 2. Zero-Input Response (ZIR) Tracking

The **Zero-Input Response (ZIR)** is the component of the total response caused by **stored energy** (initial conditions) when the external input sources are zeroed.

### ZIR Input vs. Output Tracking

| Parameter | Definition/Input | Output/Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input (Cause)** | **Initial Condition Sources:** These are $s$-domain sources inserted into the circuit model to represent stored energy. For a capacitor, this might be a voltage source of $V_c(0)/s$ in series with $1/(sC)$. For an inductor, this might be a voltage source of $L i_L(0)$ in series with $sL$. | **ZIR Output:** $V_{out, ZIR}(s)$ or $I_{out, ZIR}(s)$. |
| **Circuit State** | All external voltage sources are replaced by short circuits, and all external current sources are replaced by open circuits. | The ZIR is calculated using the initial condition sources and the component impedances ($R$, $sL$, $1/sC$). |
| **Relationship** | The ZIR is composed entirely of the **natural response** of the circuit, determined by the circuit's poles. |

## 3. The Role of the Network Function $H(s)$

The network function $H(s)$ acts as the bridge that connects the ZSR input and output, but it **does not account for the ZIR**.

### Network Function Calculation

1.  **Requirement:** $H(s)$ is strictly the ratio of the ZSR output to the ZSR input in the $s$-domain.
2.  **Procedure:** To find $H(s)$, you must explicitly set all initial condition sources to zero.
3.  **Inputs and Outputs:**
    *   If $H(s)$ is a **Transfer Function** (T(s)), the input and output are at two different terminal pairs (ports).
    *   If $H(s)$ is a **Driving-Point Impedance** ($Z(s) = V(s)/I(s)$) or **Admittance** ($Y(s) = I(s)/V(s)$), the input and output are measured at the same terminal pair.

### Using $H(s)$ for Total Response

The total response $V_{out}(s)$ is the sum of the calculated ZSR and ZIR components:
$$V_{out}(s) = V_{out, ZSR}(s) + V_{out, ZIR}(s)$$
where:
$$V_{out, ZSR}(s) = H(s) \cdot V_{in}(s)$$

This $V_{out}(s)$ is then transformed back into the time domain $v_{out}(t)$ using the Inverse Laplace Transform. The poles of $V_{out}(s)$ determine the partial fraction expansion terms and thus the final time-domain waveform.

## 4. Relationship Between $H(s)$ and Differential Equations (Diffeq)

The structure of the network function directly dictates the form of the input-output differential equation (ODE) of the circuit.

### Poles (Denominator $D(s)$) $\rightarrow$ Output (ZIR/Natural Response)

*   **Diffeq Side:** The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $D(s)$ correspond to the coefficients of the **output variable and its derivatives** on the left side of the ODE.
*   **Response Link:** Poles determine the exponents (rates) of the terms that form the **natural response** (and thus the ZIR). Poles are the rates of exponentials that are "always" in the output.

### Zeros (Numerator $N(s)$) $\rightarrow$ Input (ZSR/Forced Response Interaction)

*   **Diffeq Side:** The coefficients of the numerator polynomial $N(s)$ correspond to the coefficients of the **input variable and its derivatives** on the right side of the ODE.
*   **Response Link:** Zeros determine the frequencies (rates) of exponentials that are **never in the output**. If an exponential input occurs at the frequency of a circuit zero, that signal is blocked or vanishes in the output (provided the input pole is not of a higher order than the circuit zero).

### Step-by-Step Guide to Derive the ODE from $H(s)$

1.  **Define $H(s)$:** Start with the network function expressed as a rational function, e.g., $H(s) = \frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)} = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$.
2.  **Cross-Multiply:** Rearrange the equation: $V_{out}(s) \cdot D(s) = V_{in}(s) \cdot N(s)$.
3.  **Substitute $s$ for $\frac{d}{dt}$:** Use the differentiation property of the Laplace Transform, recognizing that multiplication by $s$ in the $s$-domain corresponds to differentiation in the time domain, *provided all initial conditions are zero* (which is true for the ZSR/network function context).
4.  **Write the ODE:** Apply the inverse LT to obtain the final time-domain differential equation relating the output $v_{out}(t)$ and input $v_{in}(t)$.

For example, if $H(s) = \frac{s+2}{s^2 + 3s + 1}$, the resulting ODE is:
$$\left(s^2 + 3s + 1\right) V_{out}(s) = \left(s+2\right) V_{in}(s)$$
$$\frac{d^2 v_{out}(t)}{dt^2} + 3 \frac{d v_{out}(t)}{dt} + v_{out}(t) = \frac{d v_{in}(t)}{dt} + 2 v_{in}(t)$$

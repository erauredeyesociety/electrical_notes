Factor and Set Up PFE: Factor the denominator of the PRF to find all poles ($p_i$). Write the resulting PRF in its PFE form, ensuring that you include all necessary terms for complex and multiple-order poles. Calculate Residues ($k_i$): Distinct Real Poles: Use the cover-up method to find each residue $k_i$. Complex Conjugate Poles: Use the cover-up method for one complex pole.

Multiple-Order Poles: Use the cover-up method for the highest order term, and use methods like matching coefficients to find lower-order residues. Inverse Transform: Convert each PFE term back into the time domain $f(t)$. Remember that terms derived from the polynomial part of an IRF correspond to impulse functions.
